## 2023.6
June 2023

Improvements on session management, restarting sessions and more:

- Added `WHATSAPP_RESTART_ALL_SESSIONS=True`: Set this variable to `True` to start all **STOPPED** sessions after
  container restarts. By default, this variable is set to `False`.
  - Please note that this will start all **STOPPED** sessions, not just the sessions that were working before the
    restart. You can maintain the session list by
    using `POST /api/session/stop` with the `logout: True` parameter or by calling `POST /api/session/logout` to remove
    **STOPPED** sessions. You can see all sessions, including **STOPPED** sessions, in the `GET /api/sessions/all=True`
    response.
- `WHATSAPP_START_SESSION` now support more than one session! Separate session names by command, and it'll start them
  ALWAYS after container restart `WHATSAPP_START_SESSION=session1,session2`
- `WHATSAPP_SWAGGER_CONFIG_ADVANCED=true` enables advanced configuration options for Swagger documentation - you can customize host, port and base URL for the requests.
  Disabled by default.
- Added `?all=true` parameter to `GET /api/session?all=True` endpoint - it'll show you ALL session, included **STOPPED
  **, so you can know which one will be restarted if you set `WHATSAPP_RESTART_ALL_SESSIONS=True` environment variable.
- Added `POST /api/sessions/logout` that allow you to logout from session - remove saved credentials.
- Added `logout` boolean parameter to `POST /api/sessions/stop` request that allow you to stop the session AND logout at
  the same time.
- Added [How to deploy page ->]({{< relref "/docs/how-to/deploy" >}}) with
  [docker-compose.yaml](https://github.com/devlikeapro/whatsapp-http-api/blob/core/docker-compose.yaml) example
- Added `engine` field in webhook payload

```json
{
  "event": "message",
  "session": "default",
  "engine": "WEBJS",
  "payload": {}
}
```

## 2023.5

## 2022.11

**Please test changes in test environment before update production!!**

**Engine** ![](/images/versions/core.png)

1. WAHA has changed its underlying engine from Venom to Whatsapp Web.JS. It might change the response and webhook's
   payloads.
2. Optimize CPU and memory consumption.

**Requests** ![](/images/versions/core.png)

- For all `/api/session/` requests use `name` field instead of `sessionName`.
- For all "chatting" requests use `session` field instead of `sessionName`.

**Sessions** ![](/images/versions/plus.png)

Now you don't have to scan QR code each time you run WAHA, WAHA saves it for you! Available only in Plus version.

**Authentication** ![](/images/versions/plus.png)

Now you can authenticate all requests for WAHA - use `WHATSAPP_API_KEY=secret` environment variable to set "secret key".

If `WHATSAPP_API_KEY` is set - requests must have `X-Api-Key` header with `secret` value, where `secret` - any random
secret key.

**Webhooks** ![](/images/versions/core.png)

Instead of setting each webhook via environment variables - we use two environments variables:

- `WHATSAPP_HOOK_URL` - to set a URL
- `WHATSAPP_HOOK_EVENTS` - to set events that are sent to the URL

** Webhook payload**

The data for webhooks are wrapped inside a new `WAWebhook` object with `event` and `payload` fields to help you identify
which handler you should call based on `event`.

```json
{
  "event": "message.any",
  "payload": {
  }
}
```
