## Endpoints
See the list of engines [**that support the features ->**]({{< relref "/docs/how-to/engines#features" >}}).

### Start

In order to start a new session - call `POST /api/sessions/start`

```json
{
  "name": "default"
}
```
#### Configure webhooks
You can configure webhooks for a session:
```json
{
  "name": "default",
  "config": {
    "webhooks": [
      {
        "url": "https://httpbin.org/post",
        "events": [
          "message"
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Read more about available options on [**Webhooks page ->**]({{< relref "/docs/how-to/webhooks#hmac-authentication" >}})

The configuration is saved and will be applied if the docker container restarts,
and you set `WHATSAPP_RESTART_ALL_SESSIONS` environment variables.
Read more about it in [Autostart section](#autostart).

#### Configure proxy
You can configure proxy for a session by setting `config.proxy` fields:
- `server` - proxy server address, without `http://` or `https://` prefixes
- `username` and `password` - set this if the proxy requires authentication


**No authentication**
```json
{
  "name": "default",
  "config": {
    "proxy": {
      "server": "localhost:3128"
    }
  }
}
```

**Proxy with authentication**
```json
{
  "name": "default",
  "config": {
    "proxy": {
      "server": "localhost:3128",
      "username": "username",
      "password": "P@ssw0rd"
    }
  }
}
```

The configuration is saved and will be applied if the docker container restarts,
and you set `WHATSAPP_RESTART_ALL_SESSIONS` environment variables.
Read more about it in [Autostart section](#autostart).

You can configure proxy when for all sessions by set up environment variables.
Read more about it on [**Configuration page** ->]({{< relref "/docs/how-to/config#proxy" >}}).

### List

To get session list - call `GET /api/sessions`.

The response:

```json
[
  {
    "name": "default",
    "status": "STARTING"
  }
]
```

You can add `?all=true` parameter to the request `GET /api/session?all=True` it'll show you ALL session,
including **STOPPED**,
so you can know which one will be restarted if you set `WHATSAPP_RESTART_ALL_SESSIONS=True` environment variable.

### Stop

In order to stop a new session - call `POST /api/sessions/stop`

{{< alert icon="ðŸ‘‰" text="The stop request does not log out the account by default. Set 'logout' field to 'true'." />}}

```json
{
  "name": "default",
  "logout": true
}
```

### Logout

In order to log out the session - call `POST /api/sessions/logout`

{{< alert icon="ðŸ‘‰" text="You must stop session first." />}}

```json
{
  "name": "default",
  "logout": true
}
```
### Get screenshot
Get screenshot of the session's screen.

```bash
GET /api/screenshot?session=default
```

#### Get screenshot in Base64
You can get screenshot in base64 format by adding `Accept: application/json` header to the request.

```bash
GET /api/screenshot?session=default
Accept: application/json
```

```json
{
  "mimetype": "image/png",
  "data": "base64-encoded-data"
}
```

You can change it in Swagger by clicking on **Media Type** dropdown and selecting **application/json**:

![](/images/swagger-media-type.png)


### Get me

Get information about the associated account for that session (if any).
```bash
GET /api/sessions/{session}/me
```

**Authenticated and working** session's response:
```json
{
  "id": "11111111111@c.us",
  "pushName": "string"
}
```

**Stopped** or **not authenticated** session returns null:
```json
null
```



### Get QR
See the list of engines [**that support the features ->**]({{< relref "/docs/how-to/engines#features" >}}).

The simplest way to authenticate a new session - get QR code and scan it on your device.
```bash
GET /api/{session}/auth/qr
```
You'll get QR image that you can scan and get authenticated

#### QR formats
You can get QR in different formats:
1. **binary image** - `GET /api/{session}/auth/qr`
2. **base64 image** - `GET /api/{session}/auth/qr` and set `Accept: application/json` header
3. **raw** - `GET /api/{session}/auth/qr?format=raw`

Here's detailed information about each format:

1. **binary image**, binary image - **default** format, you'll get image in response
```bash
# Get image - binary
GET /api/{session}/auth/qr

# OR
GET /api/{session}/auth/qr?format=image

# OR specify Accept header as well
GET /api/{session}/auth/qr?format=image
Accept: image/png
```

2. **base64 image** - you'll get image in base64 format in response if you set `Accept: application/json` header.
```bash
GET /api/{session}/auth/qr?format=image
Accept: application/json
```

```json
{
  "mimetype": "image/png",
  "data": "base64-encoded-data"
}
```

You can change it in Swagger by clicking on **Media Type** dropdown and selecting **application/json**:

![](/images/swagger-media-type.png)

3. **raw** - you'll get raw data in response, you can use it to generate QR code on your side
```bash
GET /api/{session}/auth/qr?format=raw
```

```json
{
  "value": "value-that-you-need-to-use-to-generate-qr-code"
}
```

### Get pairing code
See the list of engines [**that support the features ->**]({{< relref "/docs/how-to/engines#features" >}}).

You can [link a session with phone number](https://faq.whatsapp.com/1324084875126592) - make a request to the endpoint.
```bash
POST /api/{session}/auth/request-code
```

Body example:
```json
{
  "phoneNumber": "12132132130"
}
```

You'll get code in the response that you can use on your WhatsApp app to connect the session:
```json
{
  "code": "ABCD-ABCD"
}
```


## Webhooks
See the list of engines [**that support the feature ->**]({{< relref "/docs/how-to/engines#features" >}}).

### session.status
The `session.status` event is triggered when the session status changes.
- `STOPPED` - session is stopped
- `STARTING` - session is starting
- `SCAN_QR_CODE` - session is required to scan QR code or login via phone number
- `WORKING` - session is working and ready to use
- `FAILED` - session is failed due to some error. It's likely that authorization is required again or device has been disconnected from that account.
  Try to restart the session and if it doesn't help - logout and start the session again.

```json
{
    "event": "session.status",
    "session": "default",
    "me": {
        "id": "7911111@c.us",
        "pushName": "~"
    },
    "payload": {
        "status": "WORKING"
    },
    "engine": "WEBJS",
    "environment": {
        "version": "2023.10.12",
        "engine": "WEBJS",
        "tier": "PLUS"
    }
}
```


## Advanced sessions ![](/images/versions/plus.png)

With [WAHA Plus version]({{< relref "plus-version" >}}) you can save session state to avoid scanning QR code everytime,
configure autostart options so when the docker container restarts - it restores all previously run sessions!

### Session persistent

#### File storage
If you want to save your session and do not scan QR code everytime when you launch WAHA - connect a local file storage
to the container. WAHA stores authentication information in the directory and reuses it after restart.

[Attach volume](https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/) part to the command:

```bash
-v `pwd`/.sessions:/app/.sessions
```

The full command would be:

```bash
docker run -d -v `pwd`/.sessions:/app/.sessions -p 3000:3000/tcp --name whatsapp-http-api devlikeapro/whatsapp-http-api-plus
```

#### Remote storage ![](/images/versions/soon.png)

If you're interested in using some "remote" storage (like Redis or other Databases) to save sessions - please create an
issue on GitHub.

For instances, it may be useful if you run WAHA in a cluster of servers and do not have shared file storage

### Autostart
If you don't want to call `POST /api/sessions/start` for every session each time when the container restart -
you can use set of these environment variables to start sessions for you:

- `WHATSAPP_RESTART_ALL_SESSIONS=True`: Set this variable to `True` to start all **STOPPED** sessions after container
  restarts. By default, this variable is set to `False`.
  - Please note that this will start all **STOPPED** sessions, not just the sessions that were working before the restart. You can maintain the session list by
    using `POST /api/session/stop` with the `logout: True` parameter or by calling `POST /api/session/logout` to remove
    **STOPPED** sessions. You can see all sessions, including **STOPPED** sessions, in the `GET /api/sessions/all=True`
    response.
- `WHATSAPP_START_SESSION=session1,session2`: This variable can be used to start sessions with the specified names right
  after launching the API. Separate session names with a comma.


### Multiple sessions

If you want to save server's CPU and Memory - run multiple sessions inside one docker container!
[Plus version]({{< relref "plus-version" >}}) supports multiple sessions in one container.
